      <p><em>Future Founder and CEO of Zinger<strong><a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/visual-arts">Why art is created</a></strong></em></p>
      <p>I want to help artists become successful and more well known than if they were to only use Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter as their main source of support. By creating Zinger, artists will not only be able to post their artwork, but they will be able to collaborate with other artists, sell their art, and purchase art as well.</p></td>
